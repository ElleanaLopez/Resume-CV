# Resume-CV

Hello! My name is Elleana Lopez, but most people just call me Ellie. This is my general introduction to my Resume/CV, which will be be provided in links below. My primary goal is to study literature, and to answer fundamental questions about the nature of literature and why that is important. During my time at Lindenwood, I also decided to study Philosophy and Religion, which has helped me develop critical thinking and strong arguments. 
These two fields of study have given me a unique perspective that bridges the humanities and critical thinking. Studying English literature has cultivated analytical and communication skills, where my work in Philosophy and Religion has developed my understanding of complex social ideas and ethical consideration. This prepares me well for engaging with students and apply the same critical thinking skills across various subjects. 
While my academic background forms the foundation of my qualifications, my work experience has taught me a different but complimentary set of skills that can be applied generally. As a server for a catering company, I learned how to work under pressure and manage time efficiently, as well as communicating with a variety of people. My role as a server and cook at a chocolate shop taught me to apply creativity and attention to detail.
