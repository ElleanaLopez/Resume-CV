# Resume-CV

Welcome to my cover letter!

My name is Elleana Lopez, but everyone calls me Ellie. As a current undergraduate student at Lindenwood University, I am pursuing a double major in English Literature and Philosophy/Religion with an expected graduation in May 2025. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to and learn from a dynamic adacemic environment, and I would love to work in a classroom with other students.

My interdisciplinary background has equipped me with a unique set of skills that I believe would be valuable in a graduate assistant role. Through my studies in English Literature, I have honed my research and academic writing abilities, developing a keen eye for detail and a capacity for critical analysis. My work in Philosophy/Religion has further refined my analytical thinking and argumentation skills, allowing me to approach complex issues from multiple perspectives.

While my academic experiences form the foundation of my qualifications, my work history has also contributed significantly to my skill set. As a server for a catering company, I developed strong communication and interpersonal skills, learning to work effectively under pressure and as part of a team. My role as a server and cook at a chocolate shop further enhanced my ability to multitask, pay attention to detail, and creatively solve problems â€“ all skills that I believe would translate well to the demands of a graduate assistant position.
